Functionality Issues:
- Users should be able to move tasks between projects. (Dragging? Setting?)
- When creating or editing a task, user should be able to pick dependency (dropdown of other tasks with checkbox), which means this task should be done after the dependencies are done (dependencies are pre-reqs)
- Recurrence is not implemented.

UI issues:
- The contrast for Cancel button in task creation is off, gray text on dark background doesn't work.
- The button styling is off on Windows, having white background for button and white text.
