Functionality Issues:
- Users should be able to move tasks between projects. (Three dots - Move to - Project Dropdown similar to todoist)
- Recurrence is not implemented.
- Tasks need to have a planned time (default to none, which will automatically have a reminder notification set/updated when the planned time is set or updated.)
- Need to handle notification for AI created tasks & allow AI to CRUD notifications for a task.
- P1: When creating or editing a task, user should be able to pick dependency (dropdown of other tasks with checkbox), which means this task should be organized after the dependencies are done (dependencies are pre-reqs)
