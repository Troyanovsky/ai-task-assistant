Functionality Issues:
- Users should be able to move tasks between projects. (Dragging? Setting?)
- When creating or editing a task, user should be able to pick dependency (dropdown of other tasks with checkbox), which means this task should be done after the dependencies are done (dependencies are pre-reqs)
- Recurrence is not implemented.
- i created a task with two notifications, but when i edit the task i don't see the notifications listed, and i didn't see the notification at the time I set. please fix this issue and also add some log for successfully created/saved notifications so that i know if they're actually created or not.
