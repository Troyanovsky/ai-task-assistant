Issues:
- Can we detect if users have turned on system notification? Especially on Mac, I have to go to system settings and turn on notifications for Electron to see my app's notifciations when i npm run electron:dev.
- P1: When creating or editing a task, user should be able to pick dependency (dropdown of other tasks with checkbox), which means this task should be organized after the dependencies are done (dependencies are pre-reqs)
- P1: Recurrence is not implemented. (Need to design recurrence logic & UI)

Time issue:
Need to:
- Check if there is default notification for due date.

**app/electron-main/aiService.js:**

5.  **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling, especially around API calls and function executions.
6.  **Context Management**: The way project info and date/time are added to the message could be improved. Consider a more structured approach using JSON or a dedicated context object.
7.  **Function Call Handling**: The nested function call handling logic is quite complex and repetitive. Refactor this into a more modular and reusable function.
8.  **Date Parsing**: The date parsing logic in `executeFunctionCall` is complex. Consider using a dedicated date parsing library like `date-fns` or `Moment.js` to simplify and standardize date handling.
9.  **LLM API Request Logging**:  While logging the API request is good, consider adding a feature flag or environment variable to control the logging level, especially for sensitive data.
10. **Function Schemas**: Load function schemas dynamically only when needed, instead of on every LLM call.

**app/src/services/notification.js:**

11. **Singleton**: While using a singleton is a common pattern, consider whether it's truly necessary. Dependency injection might offer more flexibility for testing and future extensions.
12. **Notification Content**: The `getDefaultMessage` function could be extended to support more dynamic messages or allow customization.
13. **Electron Notification**: The `ipcMain.emit` calls within `sendNotification` should be reviewed. It's generally recommended to use `webContents.send` for sending messages to the renderer process.
14. **Notification Scheduling**: Ensure that the notification scheduling mechanism is robust and handles edge cases like system clock changes or app restarts gracefully.

**app/src/services/project.js:**

15. **Error Handling**: Add more specific error handling for database operations.
16. **Search**: Consider adding pagination to the `searchProjects` function to handle large datasets.

**app/src/services/task.js:**

17. **Data Validation**: Improve data validation for task properties, especially around date and time formats.
18. **Circular Dependencies**: Be mindful of potential circular dependencies between `task.js` and `notification.js` when deleting tasks and associated notifications.
19. **Date Handling**: Standardize date handling across the service to avoid inconsistencies.
20. **Prioritization**: The `prioritizeTasks` function could be optimized for performance, especially if the number of tasks grows large. Consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm or data structure.

These suggestions aim to improve the codebase's maintainability, robustness, and scalability. They cover aspects from code structure and error handling to data validation and performance optimization.
