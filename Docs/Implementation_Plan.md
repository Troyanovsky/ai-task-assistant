   - Mitigation: Implement pagination and virtual scrolling early

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Risk: UI or features might not work consistently across platforms
   - Mitigation: Test on all target platforms from Phase 2 onwards

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Features might expand beyond initial requirements
   - Mitigation: Strictly follow the phased approach and prioritize MVP features

2. **Timeline Slippage**
